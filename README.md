# Understanding-Flight-Delays

## Goals
- Investigate the underlying factors contributing to flight delays by analyzing various parameters such as wind speed and direction across a wide range of airports.
- Conduct an in-depth analysis to investigate how arrival and departure patterns across different aircraft carriers might impact carrier delay times.
- Explore whether there is any correlation between delays caused by weather conditions and those arising from the cascading effects of arrival and departure delay times.

## How to Run It?
- The IPython Notebook provided in this repository serves as our end-to-end code. Each code block can be re-run to view the analysis step by step.
